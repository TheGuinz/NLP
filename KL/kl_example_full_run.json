       "Document Title":"Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library Systems",
       "Document Body":"Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.."

In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly. One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated. Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions. It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis. The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on. Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology. On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today."

       "Document Body":"From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted a pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog cards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school: anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms: U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting \"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty. The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI service continued.."

Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery.. Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans.. We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between the reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for.."

Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development. These questions seem to be of such importance to scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right. Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can therefore be investigated as an epidemic process. Consequently, a new set of mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of scientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area of scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the given area. The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it to the development of knowledge about mast cells. In his recent comprehensive survey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a \"full bibliography\" in which \"every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with.\" This bibliography constitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of scientific ideas, since it provides us with all the contributions to the subject area, from Ehrlich's discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963."

For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index. These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search. The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts. ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work. Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type."

The particular contributions made in this article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this third section. News Services, the fourth section, required a considerable degree of selection among a wealth of material, and is indicative of the wide variety of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer. The considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the first selection of this section, while those that follow describe specific services now being offered, or services in the planning stage. The material in the fifth section, Catalogs and the Computer, is on a subject that has elicited considerable discussion. The two articles selected are on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative costs. The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of view. The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably represented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional readings.

The descriptor dictionary includes general and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords.. The indexing procedure includes: analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document.. Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given.. Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests.. Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language..

Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need. It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."

There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services.

It thus comparizes simple and \"fused\" (ortho- and ortho-peri-fused), or annelated, systems (including spiro forms), but not systems like biphenyl or triphenylmethane, in which the rings are united only by valences or by atoms not belonging to the rings. Some systems are included in which a polar valence is involved, e.g. the four-membered ring of betaine, since these are often shown in formulas as if true rings; but in such cases the presence of the polar bond is noted. Polar bonds in metallic salts (e.g. calcium succinate) are disregarded as ring formers; so also are coordinate linkages (as in the chelate compounds). The word \"system\" is used to mean a single ring or a combination of rings united one to another by atoms common to both. Except for some special reason, only systems representing known compounds of generally accepted structure, or definitely believed by authors to have a certain structure, are included. The fact that a compound must have one or two alternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based on either of them. Where there is doubt about an entry a query (?) is inserted after the reference."

       "Document Body":"From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted a pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog cards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school: anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms: U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting \"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty. The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI service continued.."

The contribution of these library personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations. However, as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved, there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from the various professions. In the present study, most of these differences related to the input into and control over the policies of the national structure. Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended model are presented at the end of Chapter 4.

Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision.. A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was made to identify reasons for failure.."

Some librarians think it is, and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who, like the Classification Research Group, actually spend years of their time in theoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse and difficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise. Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library scene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the Decimal Classification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography) for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians, and still more information officers, are busy revising the Universal Decimal Classification in order to make it more detailed. In the next field, as it were, computerized indexing and retrieval systems are pounding away at the ever-growing masses of literature, producing results that impress computer specialists but not information users, who are so deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new."

The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement and conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing and computerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certain traditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplines for main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, in certain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-term concepts..

As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation.. The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research.."

       "Document Body":"The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval language for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical document collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes general and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords.. The indexing procedure includes: analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document.. Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given.. Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests.. Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical sensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for document and request indexing.."

It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect they will have on society. These inventions include: The communication satellite. Suddenly this has provided telephone and television links to the underdeveloped world. Much larger satellites will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and communications both in the United States and throughout the world. The satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields ploughed by oxen. The helical waveguide. A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000 simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances. The laser. This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory, has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls or their equivalent. Large-scale integration (LSI). A form of ultraminiaturized computer circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of computers and computerlike logic circuitry. It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers. If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost. On-line real-time computers. Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking. They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home. Picturephone. A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other. Large TV screens. TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary. Cable TV. Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable. It could be used for signals other than television. Voice answerback. Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone. This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal. Millimeter-wave radio. Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined. Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals. Pulse code modulation. All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this. Computerized switching. Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and \"concentrating\" all types of signals. Data banks. Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a fraction of a second."

Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision..

       "Document Body":"The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review chapters. The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures. Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands. Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups. It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue. Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector. The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes. The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information. Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques."

       "Document Title":"Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library Systems",
       "Document Body":"Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.."

This is not a book, to state the proposition in the negative, for those who wish to read on the theoretical aspects of computers. The selections are brought together in seven sections. The first, the Challenge, includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age of the computer. The second section, Varieties of Response, does not by any means exhaust developments in American libraries. It does, I believe, contain representative descriptions of some of the best work being accomplished. The third section, Theory of Management, contains an outstanding article by Richard DeGennaro of Harvard. The particular contributions made in this article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this third section. News Services, the fourth section, required a considerable degree of selection among a wealth of material, and is indicative of the wide variety of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer. The considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the first selection of this section, while those that follow describe specific services now being offered, or services in the planning stage. The material in the fifth section, Catalogs and the Computer, is on a subject that has elicited considerable discussion. The two articles selected are on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative costs. The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of view. The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably represented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional readings. The seventh section, Information Retrieval Testing, is a subject which has excited the attention of but few librarians, yet its influence on subject indexing could in time prove considerable."

Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery.. Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans.. We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between the reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for.."

The system, called AIM-TWX, was sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California.. Citations from 109 clinically-oriented journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line.. Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog.. The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations.. At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and 5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center..

Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."

       "Document Body":"Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others..

       "Document Title":"Effectiveness of Combining Title Words and Index Terms in Machine Retrieval Searches",
       "Document Body":"Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we used the generalized file-management system, Master Control, which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode. The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs. For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs. For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each word was found. (In Master Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma, colon, etc.) On the other hand, in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word, character by character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming process for large data bases. We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched. Individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and titles and index terms combined. NSA index terms are controlled by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA. We used two criteria in the study. First, the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel. Some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI basis. The others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment. Second, citations obtained were to be considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered \"false drops,\" regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation."

       "Document Body":"Communication technology has entered a period of revolutionary change. The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential. It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect they will have on society. These inventions include: The communication satellite. Suddenly this has provided telephone and television links to the underdeveloped world. Much larger satellites will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and communications both in the United States and throughout the world. The satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields ploughed by oxen. The helical waveguide. A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000 simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances. The laser. This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory, has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls or their equivalent. Large-scale integration (LSI). A form of ultraminiaturized computer circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of computers and computerlike logic circuitry. It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers. If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost. On-line real-time computers. Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking. They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home. Picturephone. A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other. Large TV screens. TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary. Cable TV. Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable. It could be used for signals other than television. Voice answerback. Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone. This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal. Millimeter-wave radio. Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined. Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals. Pulse code modulation. All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this. Computerized switching. Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and \"concentrating\" all types of signals. Data banks. Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a fraction of a second."

       "Document Body":"Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrieve not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasions determined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of the techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" are retrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providing or \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages for screening retrieval output.. Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntactic joints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well.. The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determining when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers.. In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results.. The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" and it is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better..

The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfaces are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by the National Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimental retrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineering the right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, concerted effort to engineer user acceptance..

       "Document Body":"From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted a pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog cards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school: anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms: U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF)..

The \"classification\" phase matches each word of a document title against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the document using weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary. Heuristic techniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, past tenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classification phase. The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis of chemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influence the section to which the documents are assigned. Program performance and human consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program results against the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment with people experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections.

The descriptor dictionary includes general and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords.. The indexing procedure includes: analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document.. Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given.. Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests.. Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language..

In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages for screening retrieval output.. Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntactic joints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well..

       "Document Body":"Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.."

The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs. For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs. For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each word was found. (In Master Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma, colon, etc.) On the other hand, in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word, character by character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming process for large data bases. We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched. Individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and titles and index terms combined. NSA index terms are controlled by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA. We used two criteria in the study. First, the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel. Some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI basis. The others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment. Second, citations obtained were to be considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered \"false drops,\" regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation."

Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need. It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."

The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school: anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms: U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting \"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty. The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI service continued.."

       "Document Body":"There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of the advances made through research and practice. Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need. It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."

The title expressed by a noun phrase or a noun clause is converted to a function-expression by parsing. For the retrieval with a reasonable recall rate as well as a high precision rate, the function- expression is transformed to a predicate-governor form, and then normalized to a standard form. Therefrom, various items are extracted and recorded in a hierarchical tree-like inverted file. In order to keep the recall rate in a reasonable value, several retrieval stages are implemented based on the key-term and case-label matching.

       "Document Body":"This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms..

       "Document Title":"Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library Systems",
       "Document Body":"Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.."

The parameters a, b, and c are the slope, the intercept, and the shift in a straight line to log rank, respectively.

       "Document Body":"Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold. He is careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, in case the value of the aging factor a or the contents of the Bradford set change from year to year. There is as yet very little experimental evidence on the consistency of either. Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor is reasonably constant. But the position of the Bradfod set is less satisfactory. The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M. Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in the Journal of Ecology three or more times in 1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in both. Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant. There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers. There is no mention of the type of data to use. The reader who sought guidance from the earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in terms of library use. Krauze and Hillinger have discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations to that article. Their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than Brookes suggests. In any case, the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close. For example, one item in a list of references is often intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers. Again, each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of which he has consulted in a library. In neither case is there any inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers."

Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery.. Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans.. We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical..

       "Document Body":"A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968.. Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision.. A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was made to identify reasons for failure.."

       "Query":"Many information scientists are concerned with the operation of document retrieval systems serving scientists in various fields. The scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters. Often such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm. The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis. I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic. Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed. For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers. Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge. For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time. The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus. For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes. This definition of concept structure is similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.",

It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."

The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms..

       "Document Title":"Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library Systems",
       "Document Body":"Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.."

One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."

       "Document Body":"The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review chapters. The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures. Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands. Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups. It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue. Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector. The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes. The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information. Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques."

An experimental retrieval system, named CONIT, was built and tested under controlled conditions with inexperienced end users. A detailed analysis of the experimental usages showed that users were able to master interface operation sufficiently well to find relevant document references. Success was attributed, in part, to a simple command language, adequate online instruction, and a simplified natural-language, keyword/stem approach to searching. It is concluded that operational interfaces of the type studied can provide for increased usability of existing system in a cost effective manner, especially for searchers.

       "Document Body":"An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli used to represent documents in information retrieval systems. In effect, since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon the examination of one \"level of processing\" of the document (e.g., the citation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the properties of what constitutes \"relevance\". However, prior to such an analysis, an even more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portions of a document should be examined. An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs), functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents by motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlled experimental conditions. The hypothesis that there might be other intermediate response products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph, last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would be representative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation and abstract) was tested systematically. The results showed that: 1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document; 2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs; 3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and 4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not substantive. Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous work with unmotivated subjects."

       "Document Body":"From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted a pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog cards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school: anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms: U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting \"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty. The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done..

But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery.. Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans..

(3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences among users of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation and evaluation of retrieval systems.. It appears that consideration of these factors will improve system cost-performance.."

       "Query":"A study was carried out of the relationship between the vocabulary of user queries and the vocabulary of documents relevant to the queries, and the value of adding to the document description record in a retrieval system keywords from previous queries for which the document had proved useful. Two test databases incorporating user query keywords were implemented at the School of Library and Information Science, University of Western Ontario. Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, a statistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrieval tests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords. Results showed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, but indicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development and maintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.",

       "Document Title":"Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library Systems",
       "Document Body":"Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.."

       "Document Title":"Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology",
       "Document Body":"The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review chapters. The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures. Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands. Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups. It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue. Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector. The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes. The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information. Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques."

The analysis assumes that the more two authors are cited together, the closer the relationship between them. The raw data are cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social Sciences Citation Index) over the period 1972-1979. GThe resulting map shows (1) identifiable author groups (akin to \"schools\") of information science, (2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree of centrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities of authors within group and across group boundaries (\"border authors\" who seem to connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors with respect to the map's axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the most divergent groups in order to aid interpretation.

       "Document Title":"Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries",
       "Document Body":"The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system. Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators. In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work. If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design. In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2. This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system. All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables. However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery. The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science. All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion. Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists. The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame. A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries."

It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect they will have on society. These inventions include: The communication satellite. Suddenly this has provided telephone and television links to the underdeveloped world. Much larger satellites will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and communications both in the United States and throughout the world. The satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields ploughed by oxen. The helical waveguide. A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000 simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances. The laser. This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory, has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls or their equivalent. Large-scale integration (LSI). A form of ultraminiaturized computer circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of computers and computerlike logic circuitry. It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers. If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost. On-line real-time computers. Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking. They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home. Picturephone. A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other. Large TV screens. TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary. Cable TV. Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable. It could be used for signals other than television. Voice answerback. Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone. This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal. Millimeter-wave radio. Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined. Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals. Pulse code modulation. All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this. Computerized switching. Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and \"concentrating\" all types of signals. Data banks. Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a fraction of a second."
